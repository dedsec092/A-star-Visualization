A* Algorithm Visualization :

This project is a visualization of the A* algorithm, a widely-used pathfinding algorithm in computer science. The visualization provides an interactive way to understand how the A* algorithm works and how it finds the shortest path from a start point to a goal point on a grid.

Users can create obstacles, set the start and goal points, and visualize the A* algorithm in action.Step-by-step visualization: The algorithm's progress is displayed step by step, allowing users to see how the algorithm explores the grid and selects the most promising paths.Adjustable speed: Users can control the speed of the visualization to observe the algorithm's behavior at different rates.Real-time statistics: Information such as the number of nodes expanded, the length of the path found, and the total execution time is displayed in real-time.
